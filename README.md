To create Gregorian Calendar system using C.
The Gregorian calendar is the calendar used in most of the world. It was 
introduced in October 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII as a modification of the 
Julian calendar, reducing the average year from 365.25 days to 365.2425 
days, and adjusting for the drift in the 'tropical' or 'solar' year that the 
inaccuracy had caused during the intervening centuries.
The calendar spaces leap years to make its average year 365.2425 days 
long, approximating the 365.2422-day tropical year that is determined by 
the Earth's revolution around the Sun.
The logic of leap year in Gregorian Calendar system is:-
"Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years 
that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if
they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 
1900 are not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 are leap year".
The Gregorian calendar, like the Julian calendar, is a solar calendar with 
12 months of 28â€“31 days each. The year in both calendars consists of 365 
days, with a leap day being added to February in the leap years. The 
months and length of months in the Gregorian calendar are the same as for 
the Julian calendar.
